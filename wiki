## **Dropped frames:**

dropped frames can be caused by two major issues:

- camera not acquiring or sending a frame (bad pfs settings or USB connection)
    - **dropped frames csv:** we can make the camera report the timestamps of the following:
        
        GrabResultSucceeded: a frame was grabbed - Boolean
        
        GrabResultSkippedimageCount: a counter of dropped frames 
        
        if GrabResultSucceeded is False and GrabResultSkippedimageCount is rising we are losing frames and can see when this occured.
        

**FFMPEG**

### 

- **PC not writing the frame to disk (bad FFMPEG settings)**
to monitor writing to disk just look in the bonsai console. if writing speed drops below 1.0 for long → you are losing frames, or your RAM is filling up and not keeping up with writing to disk (use an SSD, and have enough storage space
use these settings:

## **cameras not detected:**
- sometimes the USB controllers in the PC get f**ed up.
    - disconnect the USB cable and connect to another port. repeat until it's detected

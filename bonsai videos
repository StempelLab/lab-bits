## **cameras not detected:**
- sometimes the USB controllers in the PC get f**ed up.
    - disconnect the USB cable and connect to another port. repeat until it's detected

## **Dropped frames:**

dropped frames can be caused by two major issues:

- camera not acquiring or sending a frame (bad pfs settings or USB connection)
    - **dropped frames csv:** we can make the camera report the timestamps of the following:
        
        GrabResultSucceeded: a frame was grabbed - Boolean
        
        GrabResultSkippedimageCount: a counter of dropped frames 
        
        if GrabResultSucceeded is False and GrabResultSkippedimageCount is rising we are losing frames and can see when this occured.
        

**FFMPEG**

### 

- **PC not writing the frame to disk (bad FFMPEG settings)**
to monitor writing to disk just look in the bonsai console. if writing speed drops below 1.0 for long â†’ you are losing frames, or your RAM is filling up and not keeping up with writing to disk (use an SSD, and have enough storage space
use these settings:

**PytlonCapture:** 

Grab strategy: OneByOne

ParameterFile: PATH\TO\YOUR.pfs file

for example: D:\bonsai\acA2040-90umNIR_25080765.pfs

SerialNumber: choose from a dropdown list

**VideoWriter:**

Filename: automatically genereated

framerate: 50

OutputArguments: 

-c:v h264_nvenc -b:v 20M -maxrate:v 20M -bufsize:v 5M -profile:v main -rc 23  -preset medium -an -gpu 0

the key arguments to tune: 

-c:v h264_nvenc -b:v 20M : h264 will use CPU, h264_nvenc will use GPU.

-b:v 20M: a buffer for the GPU, lower than 10-12 will create frame drops.

-preset: faster/fast/medium/slow/slower   - the slower the better the quality and the lower the file size, but more load on PC.

-rc: ratio constant- this is a quality constant  - the lower the better, with same caveats as above

-an: no sound track (reduces stream size)

-gpu: specify the index of the GPU that will do the encoding. e,g, -gpu 0
